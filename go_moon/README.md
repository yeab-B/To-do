# Go_Moon – My First Mobile App

**Go_Moon** is my first mobile app project, designed as a simple one-page application. Through this project, I learned the basics of mobile app development, including how to:

* Insert images
* Add text
* Use layout widgets like **Row**, **Column**, and **Stack**

The app displays images and content in a clean, organized layout.
